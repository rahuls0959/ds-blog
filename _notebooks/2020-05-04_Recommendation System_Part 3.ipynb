    "Collaborative Filtering models are developed using machine learning algorithms to predict a user’s rating of unrated items. There are several techniques for modeling such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Matrix Factorization, Deep Learning Models, etc. In this blog, we will be using KNN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm doesn’t make any assumptions on the underlying data distribution, but it relies on item feature similarity. When a KNN makes a prediction about an item (say, movie), it will calculate the 'distance' between the target movie and every other movie in its database. It then ranks its distances and returns the top 'k' nearest neighbor movies (smallest distance measure) as the most similar movie recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is widely used algorithm in classification models where an item is classified to one of the classes based on majority class in the k-nearest neighbour items. We have to parametrize the value of 'k' in the model. With increasing 'k', the accuracy first increases (due to over-fitting at lower 'k' values) and then decreases at large values of 'k'. The optimum values of 'k' usually lies between 3-10. (Reference - https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-nearest-neighbors-for-machine-learning/)\n",

That means that our network is being greatly influenced by heavily rated movies. In such a situation, a movie might be the best recommendation for ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ but could be overlooked by our model due to fewer ratings provided by users for said movie."

    "I hope this has helped in basic understanding of implementing collaborating filtering in Python. Feel free to play around with the code by opening in Colab or cloning the repo in github.\n",

    "However, the model has quite a number of limitations such as in case the items don't have enough number of ratings or interactions or new users don't have enough interaction on the platform, the recommendations given by CF would be quite poor. Hence, it is rare that new movies would be recommendated by the model since they would have very few ratings. Most of the recommendation systems are hybrid of different filtering techniques such as content-based and collaborative filtering to address some of these concerns.Also, with increasing base of users and movies, the KNN model would face scalability issues. There are other techniques to solve these issues.\n",
