We will scrap 1000 reviews from the Amazon for Apple iPhone 11 64GB. With this data, we will convert each review doc into bag-of words for applying the topic modeling algorithm.

    "Web scraping is a technique for extracting information from the internet automatically using a software that simulates human web surfing. Web scraping helps us extract large volumes of data about customers, products, people, stock markets, etc. It is usually difficult to get this kind of information on a large scale using traditional data collection methods. We can utilize the data collected from a website such as e-commerce portal, social media channels to understand customer behaviors and sentiments, buying patterns, and brand attribute associations which are critical insights for any business.\n",

    "The first and foremost thing while scraping a website is to understand the structure of the website. We will be scraping the reviews for Apple iPhone 11 64GB on Amazon.in website. We will scrape 1000 reviews from different users across multiple pages. We will scrape user name, date of review and review and export it into a .csv file for any further analysis."
